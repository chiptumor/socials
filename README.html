<meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"></head><body><h1>Haio! I'm Melanie Bell, or 'chiptumor.'</h1>
<p>Pings are highly preferred, and DM's are open, but please be 
substancial and tell me what you need. I hardly respond to 'Hey' or 
'Hello.'</p>
<h2>You can also find me in other places!:</h2>
<p><a href="https://youtube.com/@chiptumor" style="color: #f78c5f;">YouTube</a>: I make and post chiptune here. I'd be grateful if you checked it out!</p>
<p><a href="https://instagram.com/chiptumor" style="color: #f78c5f;">Instagram</a>: I post images of my fictional wife--the Zoologist--along with memes I find funny.</p>
<p>You can also find me on Bluesky (and Twitter) if you look hard enough, but I don't use those too often.</p>
<h2><a href="https://discord.gg/jb4b9gwWuH" style="color: #f78c5f;">Join my emoji server!</a></h2>
<p>I've been working on a bunch of pixel emojis because the default 
emojis just aren't expressive enough. I'm also seeking boosts, and I'd 
highly appreciate them!!
If you do join, <strong>please be respectful and use common sense. Make sure your profile isn't NSFW.</strong> I'm okay with suggestive profiles, but if there's outright <em>(including but not limited to)</em> tits in your PFP or banner, I'll have to kick you.</p>
<h3>Here's a few, for example:</h3>
<p><img src="README_files/1314431530713612350.png" alt=":JEcry:" title=":JEcry:"> <img src="README_files/1319113889916391424.gif" alt=":JEclock:" title=":JEclock:"> <img src="README_files/1314578827791302747.png" alt=":JEexcuseme:" title=":JEexcuseme:"> <img src="README_files/1314769671005802587.png" alt=":JEretweet:" title=":JEretweet:"> <img src="README_files/1314579492190289971.png" alt=":JEwhoa:" title=":JEwhoa:"> <img src="README_files/1314766349293195264.png" alt=":JEtomato:" title=":JEtomato:"> </p>
<h3>I'm also working on a project to create an expressive Emoji design for use in websites and apps, similarly to Twemoji.</h3>
<p>If you're interested in that--and I have no doubts you aren't, but 
I'd appreciate the attention--please come say something about it!</p>
<p><strong>I also take suggestions!!</strong> Feel free to drop something in <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1255693747488821318/1314719685773627552" style="color: #fff;">the suggestions channel</a> and I'll absolutely check it out.</p>
