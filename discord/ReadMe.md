# Haio! I'm Jennie Bell, or 'chiptumor.'
Pings are highly preferred, and DM's are open!
-# Be substancial and tell me what you need. I hardly respond to 'Hey' or 'Hello.'

## You can also find me in other places!:
* [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@chiptumor)
	* I make and post chiptune here. I'd be grateful if you checked it out!
* [Instagram](https://instagram.com/chiptumor)
	* I post images of my wife--the Zoologist--along with memes I find funny.
You can also find me on Bluesky (and Twitter) if you look hard enough, but I don't use those too often.

I've been working on a bunch of pixel emojis because the default emojis just aren't expressive enough. I'm also seeking boosts, and I'd highly appreciate them!!
If you do join, **please be respectful and use common sense. Make sure your profile isn't NSFW.** I'm okay with suggestive profiles, but if there's outright *(including but not limited to)* tits in your PFP or banner, I'll have to kick you.
### Here's a few, for example:
![:JEcry:](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1314431530713612350.png ":JEcry") ![:JEclock:](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1319113889916391424.gif ":JEclock:") ![:JEexcuseme:](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1314578827791302747.png ":JEexcuseme:") ![:JEretweet:](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1314769671005802587.png ":JEretweet:") ![:JEwhoa:](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1314579492190289971.png) ![:JEtomato:](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1314766349293195264.png ":JEtomato:") 

I'm also working on a project to create an expressive alternative to Twemoji as an open-source Emoji design. If you're interested in that--and I have no doubts you aren't, but I'd appreciate the attention--please come say something about it!
**I also take suggestions!!** Feel free to drop something in [the suggestions channel](https://discord.com/channels/1255693747488821318/1314719685773627552) and I'll absolutely check it out.
