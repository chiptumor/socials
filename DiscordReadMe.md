# Haio!
### I'm Jennie Bell, or 'sleepingisforlosers.'
* Pings are highly preferred, and DM's are open!
	* Be substancial and tell me what you need. I hardly respond to 'Hey' or 'Hello.'

## You can also find me in other places!:
* [YouTube (@jennie__bell)](https://youtube.com/@jennie__bell)
	* I make and post chiptune here. I'd be grateful if you checked it out!
* [Instagram (@jennie._bell)](https://instagram.com/jennie._bell)
	* I post images of my wife--the Zoologist--along with memes I find funny.
You can also find me on Bluesky (and Twitter), but I don't use those too often.

I've been working on a bunch of pixel emojis because the default emojis just aren't expressive enough. I'm also seeking boosts, and I'd highly appreciate them!!
If you do join, **please be respectful and use common sense. Make sure your profile isn't NSFW.** I'm okay with suggestive profiles, but if there's outright *(including but not limited to)* tits in your PFP or banner, I'll have to kick you.
### Here's a few, for example:
